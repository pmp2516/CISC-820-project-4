Code can be run simply by running project4.py. If the face identification task is what you want to run, make sure all_images is composed of train_images, train_labels and test_images, test_labels, and the eval() and get_weights() functions are run with those as well. For the binary classification test, use bin_train_images, bin_train_labels, and bin_test_images, bin_test_labels in those functions and variables.
